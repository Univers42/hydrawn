/**
 * Turns "the scene changed" into the smallest patch that still converges.
 *
 * Sending the whole scene on every stroke would push megabytes a second on a busy
 * board, so the tracker remembers what the server acknowledged and emits only the
 * difference.
 *
 * Three engine behaviours drive the design:
 *
 *  1. The exported JSON DROPS tombstones (`export_json_drops_tombstones` in
 *     crates/draw-engine/tests/draw_engine.rs), so a deletion arrives here as an id
 *     that simply vanished and the tombstone the server's merge needs has to be
 *     synthesised.
 *  2. Undo can bring a deleted element back with its ORIGINAL stamp, which would
 *     lose to the tombstone we already sent. A resurrection is therefore re-stamped
 *     to outrank it.
 *  3. Z-order is array position, and `reorder_elements` moves elements without
 *     touching stamps, so a reorder is invisible to a stamp diff. We TRY to predict
 *     the order the server will arrive at and send an explicit one on a mismatch,
 *     which is what stops a wrong prediction from persisting — the prediction is
 *     wrong for a resurrected id (see `predictOrder`).

  // every undo of a delete. `sceneDiff.merges.test.ts` pins both halves: the primitive
