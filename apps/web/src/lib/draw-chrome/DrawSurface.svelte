    The way out of zen mode, and the reason the feature is not a trap.

    Alt+Z is a chrome chord, and a chrome chord is exactly what the guard refuses while a
    field or a dialog holds the focus — so a person part-way through a text box cannot
    toggle zen mode off, which is right, and would also be stranded if this button were not
    here. The oracle answers it the same way (`Actions.tsx@1118751f:915-931`,
    `LayerUI.scss@1118751f:68-90`): a button that exists only while the flag is on, in the
    corner the hidden panels came from.

    Hidden while presenting, and paired with `!presenting` on the chord in `appShortcut`.
    Presenting hides the exit button, the palette and the main menu, so a flag that could
    be set from in there would have no way out at all; refusing the chord while presenting
    is what makes the gap harmless. Zen mode entered *before* Present survives it and the
    button is back on leaving, which is coherent: the chrome comes back, still in zen.
