/**
 * Law 3, as a test: what a pasted plain text *becomes* is the engine's to decide
 * (BUNNY.md §2), and the front only reads the clipboard and calls the engine method.
 *
 * The decisions are four and they are all scene data — one element per line, the wrap
 * width, the placement at the pointer, the element that is minted. Every one of them is
 * the oracle's `addTextFromPaste` (`packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx@1118751f:
 * 4979-5096`), and every one of them is now in `engine/crates/draw-engine/src/engine/
 * paste_text.rs`, asserted in `ci_paste_text.rs`.
 *
 * Nothing stops the next person from re-deriving one of them in a `.svelte` file, and the
 * result would still look right in a screenshot: a paste of two lines still makes two
 * elements, only the wrap width or the gap is the front's own idea now. This scan is the
 * only thing that fails. It is a source scan rather than a behavioural one precisely
 * because the behaviour it forbids is the behaviour everything else already checks.
 */

/*
 * The engine's TypeScript host (`engine/src`) is scanned as well as the front, and for
 * the same reason: it is the other place a paste is read before it reaches the engine, and
 * a `split("\n")` or a wrap constant written there is exactly as much a second answer as
 * one written in a `.svelte` file. Nothing in either tree trips the patterns today, so the
 * scan costs nothing until someone breaks law 3.
